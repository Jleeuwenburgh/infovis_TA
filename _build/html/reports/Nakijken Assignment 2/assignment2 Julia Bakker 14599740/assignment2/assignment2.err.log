For assignemnt 2,4A i used ChatGPT version 3.5 to make step1,2 aad 3. I used it to make the code en try to make it work. I entered the question and the head of the dataset tips_df that was given. 
I was not able to make the code work on my own. i didn't really know were to start with the code since there was only little explanation and no extra website given like in the other assingments.                                        
ChatGPT did most of the work for me, all i did was change the titels and the name of the xaxis for step 2 and 3. I don't know how to make a figure caption but all three figures are made with ChatGPT.
The date to create the figure is 14-06-2023.
